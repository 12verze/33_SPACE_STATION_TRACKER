APIs in python
application programing interface
programmes used to create to get live data from web and use that for our own programme

ex - yahoo weather has its yahoo weather api in which u can tap into and get data u need for ur work
basically get the in moment data to run our project or whatever
api.coinbase.com
crypto data
u have to get permission on web to get the data, its called teller and it will make link between api and us

using requests lib to get api req
response coses are like info about the status
ex - 404 - site not reached
1xx: hold on
2xx = here u go
3xx: u dont have the permission
4xx = u screwed up
5xx = the server screwed up
httpstatuses.com u can check

some api needs parameters like sunset or sunrise api, there u have to give lat and long of the location and u'll get the value
always head over to the doc of the web for further detail and syntax
